# Renewable Energy Generation in South Africa: Data Analysis with Python

In 2020 South Africa was responsible for 87% of Africa's total coal generation and faces significant challenges in decarbonising its grid. While wind and solar contributed 7% to electricity production, coal accounted for 85% of the country's energy mix in 2022.

For 16 years, South Africa has faced significant challenges concerning its energy supply, leading to daily controlled power outages implemented by the national power utility, Eskom, to prevent a total electricity grid collapse.

At the same time, the country's reliance on coal-generated power has come under scrutiny due to its significant environmental impact.

In light of these issues, the South African government has been exploring renewable energy sources to diversify the country's energy mix and reduce its carbon footprint. However, generating renewable energy sources in South Africa is challenging, as it requires significant investments in infrastructure and technology.

The $8.5bn Just Transition Partnership signed at COP26, and a commitment to decarbonise the power sector represent major steps towards South Africa's net-zero goal by 2050. However, progress towards these targets has been slow.

The objective of this data analysis project is to explore the generation of alternative energy in South Africa between 1985 and 2023.
